					<h2>About the company</h2>
					<p>
						Yota came to us to design an innovative and efficient way of talking to their customers.<br />
						The Yota app will ship pre-installed on their devices and will provide access to all services the company offers to their customers on the go,<br />
						from checking an account balance and data usage to constructing custom plans and chatting with support.

				<h4>Features</h4>
				<p>
					We wanted to design an app that closed followed the Material Design guidelines, but at the same time belonged to the Yota family.<br />
					We decided to combine Yota’s iconic look with the bright, cheerful appearance of Android Lollipop.<br />
					At the time, Material Design had just been announced and we couldn’t wait to apply its novel and purposeful iconography,<br />
					animation, and interface design principles on a real project.
