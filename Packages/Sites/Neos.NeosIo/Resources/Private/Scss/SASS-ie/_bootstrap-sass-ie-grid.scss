// This file should be included *instead of* bootstrap's _grid.scss
// to replace plain media-queries with media-queries based on the respond-min
// and respond-max mixins from SASS-ie and therefore provide a
// fallback for all grid classes for IE8.
//
// The following lines are taken directly from bootstrap's _grid.scss
// and only replace any @media.. with @include respond-min.

// Grid system
// --------------------------------------------------


// Container widths
//
// Set the container width, and override it for fixed navbars in media queries.

		width: $container-md;
	}
	@include respond-min($screen-lg-min) {
		width: $container-lg;

// Fluid container
//
// Utilizes the mixin meant for fixed width containers, but without any defined
// width for fluid, full width layouts.

	@include container-fixed;
}


// Row
//
// Rows contain and clear the floats of your columns.

.row {
	@include make-row;

// Columns
//
// Common styles for small and large grid columns

@include make-grid-columns-extended-by-xxs;

// Extra, extra small grid
//
// Columns, offsets, pushes, and pulls for extra, extra small devices like the iPhone 4/5.

@include make-grid(xxs);

// Extra small grid
//
// Columns, offsets, pushes, and pulls for extra small devices like
// smartphones.

@include respond-min($screen-xs-min) {
	@include make-grid(xs);

// Small grid
//
// Columns, offsets, pushes, and pulls for the small device range, from phones
// to tablets.

@include respond-min($screen-sm-min) {
	@include make-grid(sm);
}


// Medium grid

// Columns, offsets, pushes, and pulls for the desktop device range.

@include respond-min($screen-md-min) {
	@include make-grid(md);
